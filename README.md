## 👋 Intro 
Hi, I am Noelle, a data analyst with a BS in chemical engineering and (soon) a certificate in data analytics and visualization from the University of Texas at Austin.  I've spent the majority of my career as as an engineer working in process engineering, technical sales, customer support and training for a diverse user base to run complex commercial process simulation tools.  For the last 7 years, I have focused on working in commercial software where I developed my enthusiasm for technology and the critical role it plays in decision making, safely and efficiently.

I am currently working in data analytics, polishing my skills in 
* Python
  * Pandas
  * matplotlib
  * NumPy
  * SQLalchemy
* SQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite
* NoSQL, MongoDB
* JSON
* Tableau

I love working in engineering and data analytics because I am passionate about problem solving and leveraging data to make informed decisions. I have a strong track record working in quantitative analysis, communicating complex information in a clear and concise manner to a diverse audience.

### 👀 Looking Forward
I am enthusiastic and fiercely curious with a love for learning and experiencing new things.  
I aim to refine my skills in programming and data analytics before ultimately moving into a data science role.

When I'm not working on data, I am eagerly working to bring up the next generation of lady scientists 💪
### ✨ Other Skills
